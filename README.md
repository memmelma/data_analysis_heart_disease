# kuenstliche_intelligenz

machine learning project by Marius Memmel, Lea Schneider, Clemens Ulbrich & Paul Hermany

## Dataset
[original dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)

[kaggle dataset (used)](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## Setup
Clone the repository and run the first cell in the ```base_functions_setup``` notebook. This will install all the needed packages. After the installation, run the other cells to check if the dataset is integrated correctly.

The main notebook is called ```heart_jupyter_notebook_master```. It contains the work done by our group.

## Steps
1. Data Import
2. Data Exploration & Visualization
3. Preprocessing
4. Modeling
* Dummy Classifier
* SGDC (Linear) Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* K-Nearest-Neighbor Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
5. Summary
6. Additional Models
* XGBoost
* Neural Net with Keras

## Website
To present the project, a website was set up. The source code can be found in the ```/website``` directory. For the design the Evie template by [unDraw](https://undraw.co/evie) was used. The website can be accesed under this [link](ki.mariusmemmel.com).

## Kaggle
The notebook can also be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/veygam/ki-project-heart-disease).
